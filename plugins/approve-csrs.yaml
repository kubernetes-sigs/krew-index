    How many times has this happened to you?

    * You have an OpenShift cluster in a lab (or something like that) 👍
    * You power it off (because why run a lab OpenShift cluster 24/7) 😅
    * You power it back on a few days later 🔌
    * The web console doesn't come up 😬
    * You start digging around 🕵️
    * You notice some pending CertificateSigningRequests (CSRs) 🤦
    * You dig through your old notes or links to find the support article with
    the command approve all pending CSRs 🔎
    * You run the command to approve them 💻 * You wait 10 minutes and the web
    console comes up! 😃

    This OpenShift CLI (oc) plugin will approve all pending CSRs in a single
    command, without the need to dig through your notes, search the web, or
    memorize a monster command! 😈
  caveats: |
    This plugin requires `oc` (OpenShift CLI) instead of `kubectl` because it
    depends on the `oc adm certificates` subcommand. The plugin will error if
    you try to run it without `oc` installed.
