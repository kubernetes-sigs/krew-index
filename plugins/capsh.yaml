  description: |
    check the capabilities(7) of a running Pod.
  caveats: |
    kubectl-capsh needs capsh to run, so when executed for the first time it 
    will download that file from this repository and install it under /usr/local/bin/. 
    If you need to manualy fetch and install capsh you can grab a copy of it from this
    repo and move it to /usr/local/bin.

    Usage:
      kubectl capsh <pod>
