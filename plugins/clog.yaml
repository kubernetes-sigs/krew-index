  shortDescription: Colorize log outputs.
  homepage: https://github.com/orangetangerine/kubectl-clog
  description: |
    This is a new plugin to colorize your kubectl logs. 
    clog is just a wrapper of built-in kubectl logs, with same command usage,
    just replace `kubectl logs` with `kubectl clog`. 
    
    Some frequent log content is detected to colorizing.
    * json format log with level field. e.g. `{"level":"debug"}`
    * envoy format log via istio-proxy. e.g. `2023-12-26T07:01:24.212130Z     debug   envoy upstream`
    * istio access log. e.g. `[2023-12-26T05:45:58.421Z] "POST /package.service/method HTTP/2" 200 ...`
