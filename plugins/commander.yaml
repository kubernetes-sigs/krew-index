    kube-commander is an interactive menu (based on fzf) that allows you
    to navigate and interact with objects of your Kubernetes cluster.
    It is possible to quickly preview object configuration in YAML,
    logs, events but also edite or delete object or enter into pods.

    Help:
    $ kubectl commander -h
    [ctrl-h] inside the plugin
