  description: |
    Uses Kubecost's API to gather and format cluster cost information broken
    down by various aggregations like namespace, deployment, and label.

    Kubecost is a cluster-side daemon that tracks the real cost of Kubernetes
    resources by combining resource utilization monitoring with your provider's
    cost data. Kubecost support GCP/GKE, AWS/EKS, Azure/AKS, and custom
    (including on-prem) "providers" via user-specified pricing sheets.

  caveats: |
    Requires Kubecost (a cluster-side daemon) to be installed in your cluster.
    See https://www.kubecost.com/install for installation instructions.
