    A "kubectl get" replacement with customizable column presets.

    It's time saving to retrieve some often needed infos like
    image names, containers names, versions, labels, etc...
    It currently supports the following templates (but PRs are welcome upstream):
    - images
    - resources
    - limits
    - requests
    - annotations
    - qos-class
