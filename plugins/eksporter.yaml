    This plugin helps you export a resource, and removes a pre-defined set of
    fields. This is useful for when you have resource you want to migrate from
    one namespace or cluster, to another one, but need to edit/add some fields
    before applying.

    If you just need to move one resource, it's probably easier to just:
      kubectl get -oyaml | kubectl create -f -

    Run the tool with:
      kubectl eksporter <resource> <resource_name>
    Or with piping:
      kubectl get pods -o yaml <resource_name> | kubectl eksporter

    You can keep some of the pre-defined fields by listing them with --keep.
      kubectl eksporter ingress my-web-site --keep annotations
