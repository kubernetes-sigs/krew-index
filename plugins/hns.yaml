  shortDescription: Manage hierarchical namespaces (part of HNC)
  description: |
    Manipulates hierarchical namespaces provided by the Hierarchical Namespace
    Controller (HNC).

    HNC allows you to arrange your namespaces into hierarchies, which enables
    two key benefits:
    * Users without cluster-level permissions to create namespaces can create
      restricted "subnamespaces" instead.
    * Owners of parent namespaces can create policies that are enforced on
      all descendant namespaces.

    HNC is controlled via regular Kubernetes objects, but this plugin makes it
    easy to create subnamespaces, arrange regular (full) namespaces into
    hierarchies, and configure HNC to propagate different kinds of objects.
  version: v0.8.0
  caveats: |
    This plugin requires the most recent minor version of HNC on your cluster. Get it at:
      https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/multi-tenancy/releases/tag/hnc-v0.8.0
    or via:
      kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/multi-tenancy/releases/download/hnc-v0.8.0/hnc-manager.yaml

    This version of the plugin should work with HNC v0.6 and later - but for
    best results, use the version that matches the version of HNC on your
    cluster. If you need the plugin for HNC v0.5.x, please follow the
    installation directions from the release page for your version.

    Watch out for the following common misconceptions when using HNC:

    * Not all child namespaces are subnamespaces!
    * Only RBAC Roles and RoleBindings are propagated by default, but you can configure more.

    The user guide contains much more information.
