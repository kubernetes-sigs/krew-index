  shortDescription: Update ingress rules via command line.
  homepage: https://github.com/pragaonj/ingress-rule-updater
  description: |
    Add/remove rules to/from a kubernetes ingress via command line.
    This plugin allows the configuration of an ingress resource with command line arguments.
    
    When adding/deleting a backend rule the ingress will be updated.
    On creation of a rule for a non-existing ingress name a new ingress will be created.
    If the last rule is deleted the ingress will be deleted as well.
