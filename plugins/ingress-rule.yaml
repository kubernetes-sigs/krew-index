  shortDescription: Update Ingress rules via command line
  homepage: https://github.com/pragaonj/ingress-rule-updater
  description: |
    Add/remove rules to/from a Kubernetes Ingress via command line.
    This plugin allows the configuration of an Ingress resource with command line arguments.
    
    When adding/deleting a backend rule the Ingress will be updated.
    On creation of a rule for a non-existing Ingress name a new Ingress will be created.
    If the last rule is deleted the Ingress will be deleted as well.
