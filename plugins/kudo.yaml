  shortDescription: Declaratively build, install, and run operators using KUDO.
  homepage: https://kudo.dev/
  description: |
    The Kubernetes Universal Declarative Operator (KUDO) is a highly productive
    toolkit for writing operators for Kubernetes. Using KUDO, you can deploy
    your applications, give your users the tools they need to operate it, and
    understand how it's behaving in their environments â€” all without a PhD in
    Kubernetes.

    Example usage:
      Install kafka:
        kubectl kudo install kafka
      List installed operator instances:
        kubectl kudo get instances
    See the documentation for more information: https://kudo.dev/docs/
  caveats: |
    Requires the KUDO controller to be installed:
      kubectl kudo init
