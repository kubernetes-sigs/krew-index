  description: |
    Use kurt to see pods that are restarting in your cluster and get further context to issues by grouping the results.
    Top 5 results from all groupings:
    kubectl kurt all

    Top 5 nodes with restarting pods:
    kubectl kurt nodes

    All restarting pods in the test namespace:
    kubectl kurt pods -c 0 -n test

    Help:
    kubectl kurt -h
