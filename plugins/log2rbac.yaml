  shortDescription: "Fine-tune your RBAC using log2rbac operator"
  description: |
    Simple TUI based kubectl plugin to interface with the log2rbac operator.
    It can (un)deploy the operator and create the `RbacNegotiation` custom
    resources for various types of K8s kinds. The operator will help with
    setting up the correct RBAC rules for your application by inspecting the
    log files from pods and adding the rights violation as new rules.
    Don't use this in production, but only for development purposes!
