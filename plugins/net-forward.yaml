    A plugin similar to kubectl port-forward but without requiring users to
    enter a Pod or Svc object existing the cluster. Instead you can choose any
    IP address and port of your choosing. You could for example use it to test
    whether a Namespace is able to access a Pod's private IP in a different
    Namespace. Or use it to connect to a non-k8s service located on an adjacent
    subnet outside of the cluster itself. It does this (similar to port-forward)
    by deploying a socat Pod and listener that you can port-forward to you to
    create a local listener service (default 127.0.0.1:9999), which
    auto-forwards to the IP and port the users supplies.
