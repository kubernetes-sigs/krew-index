    Deploy a socat listener that allows you to forward to any IP/Port that's 
    accessible in the cluster. Similar to `kubectl port-forward` but without
    the requiring a kubernetes to connect to.
    
    Examples:
      kubectl net-forward
      kubectl net-forward -i kubernetes.default -p 443
      kubectl net-forward -n testnamespace -i 10.24.0.1 -p 443 -l 9999
