    kubectl exec plugin that will launch a browser to authenticate you 
    without having a pre-existing kubectl configuration file.  The first
    time you execute this plugin, include the host of your OpenUnison 
    server and the plugin will launch a browser and authenticate you.  As
    you work with kubectl it will keep your short-lived tokens updated and
    if they expire, automatically re-launch a browser window to authenticate
    you.
