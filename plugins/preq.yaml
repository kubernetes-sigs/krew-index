      `preq` (prounounced "preek") is a free and open community-driven reliability problem detector. Use `preq` to:

      * detect the latest bugs, misconfigurations, anti-patterns, and known issues from a community of practitioners
      * provide engineers, on-call support, and SRE agents with impact and community recommended mitigations
      * hunt for new problems in logs

      `preq` is powered by Common Reliability Enumerations (CREs) that are contributed by the community and [Prequel's Reliability Research Team](https://prequel.dev/blog). Reliability intelligence helps teams see a broad range of problems earlier, so they can prioritize, pinpoint, and reduce the risk of outages.

      Visit https://docs.prequel.dev for more information.

      ## Install

      ```bash
      $ kubectl krew install preq
