  shortDescription: Declarative database schema migrations via YAML
  homepage: https://schemahero.io
  caveats: |
    SchemaHero requires an in-cluster operator. To install the operator run:

      $ kubectl schemahero install
  description: |
    SchemaHero is a database schema migration tool that converts a schema
    definition into migration scripts to be applied to a database engine
    (with current support for Postgres, Mysql, rqlite and CockroachDB).

    SchemaHero allows developers to define a database table schema as a
    declarative Kubernetes object and then apply the definition to the
    cluster. The SchemaHero operator will then query the current database
    schema and generate (and optionally apply) the necessary SQL
    statements to update the database to the desired schema.
