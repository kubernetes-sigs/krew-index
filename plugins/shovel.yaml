  shortDescription: Gather diagnostics for .NET Core applications
  version: v0.7.0
  description: |
    Plugin for gathering diagnostics from running in Kubernetes .NET Core
    applications. It runs the job on the specified pod's node with a mount
    to its /tmp folder with application's diagnostic socket and runs specified
    tool against it. Supported tools are: dotnet-gcdump and dotnet-trace
  caveats: |
    It can work with .NET Core 3.0+ applications and Kubernetes clusters with
    docker or containerd runtime. Permissions to get pods and create jobs are
    required. Also it requires allowance to mount /var/lib/docker path for
    docker runtime and /run/containerd for containerd from a host in read-only
    mode
