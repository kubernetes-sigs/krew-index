  shortDescription: >-
    Toolkit for finding risks in kubernetes resources
  description: |+2
    Starboard enables results from vulnerability scanners, workload auditors,
    and configuration benchmark tests to be incorporated into Kubernetes CRDs
    (Custom Resource Definitions) and from there, accessed through the 
    Kubernetes API. 

    Users familiar with kubectl or with a dashboard tool like Octant can find
    security risk information at their fingertips.

  caveats: |
    The plugin requires access to create Jobs and CustomResources.
