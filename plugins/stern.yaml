  shortDescription: Multi pod and container log tailing
  homepage: https://github.com/stern/stern
  description: |
    Stern allows you to `tail` multiple pods on Kubernetes and multiple containers
    within the pod. Each result is color coded for quicker debugging.

    The query is a regular expression so the pod name can easily be filtered and
    you don't need to specify the exact id (for instance omitting the deployment
    id). If a pod is deleted it gets removed from tail and if a new pod is added it
    automatically gets tailed.

    When a pod contains multiple containers Stern can tail all of them too without
    having to do this manually for each one. Simply specify the `container` flag to
    limit what containers to show. By default all containers are listened to.
