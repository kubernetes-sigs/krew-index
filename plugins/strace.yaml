  description: |
    kubectl-strace is a kubectl plugin that provides the ability to easily perform
    debugging of system-calls for applications running in the cluster. 
    kubectl-strace starts a priviledged Pod and attaches an strace instance
    to one or many running Pods, displaying or collecting the results for later.
    Read more documentation see: https://github.com/michaelwasher/kstrace
  caveats: |
    This plugin requires the RBAC authority to start privileged Pods and create Namespaces.
