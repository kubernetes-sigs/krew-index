  shortDescription: Stream logs from multiple pods and containers using simple, dynamic source selection.
  description: |-
    Kail https://github.com/boz/kail - "Just show me the logs"

    Stream logs from all matched containers of all matched pods.  Match pods by service,
    replicaset, deployment, and others.  Adjusts to a changing cluster - pods are
    added and removed from logging as they fall in or out of the selection.

    Documentation:

      See https://github.com/boz/kail or

      $ kubectl tail --help

    Usage:

      # match all pods
      $ kubectl tail

      # match pods in the 'frontend' namespace
      $ kubectl tail --ns staging

      # match pods belonging to a replicaset named 'workers' in any namespace.
      $ kubectl tail --rs workers

      # match pods belonging to the replicaset named 'workers' only in the 'staging' namespace
      $ kubectl tail --rs staging/workers

      # match pods belonging to both the service "frontend" and the deployment "webapp"
      $ kubectl tail --svc frontend --deploy webapp
