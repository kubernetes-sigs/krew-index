  shortDescription: Fast diagnostics for failed pods
  homepage: https://github.com/Lc-Lin/kubectl-triage
  description: |
    kubectl-triage provides 5-second diagnostic snapshots for failed
    Kubernetes pods.

    It intelligently aggregates the critical information you need:
    - Pod status and container states
    - Critical events (Warning/Error only, filtering out noise)
    - Previous crash logs (if container restarted)
    - Current container logs

    Only failed/restarted containers are shown by default, keeping output
    focused.

    Key features:
    - Smart health detection (catches "flapping" pods)
    - Intelligent container filtering (RestartCount > 0)
    - Signal-over-noise event filtering
    - Parallel log collection for speed
    - Beautiful color-coded output
